# To-do App 

This is a simple to-do app that helps its users keep track of things they need to get done. 
I made use of state management (`useEffect` and `useState` particularly) to allow a user to add, remove, tick off and filter to-do items.

It's deployed [here](https://ajs-todo-app.netlify.app).
