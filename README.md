# To-do App 

This is a basic to-do app I built with React that allows a user to add, remove and tick off to-do items. 

It's deployed [here]()

##Components
- Filter to-do items by status in selection box ('All', 'Done', 'To do')
- Create/delete/complete to-do items

##Stack
- JavaScript
- React
- CSS/HTML
- Deployed on Netlify

Here's a demo of how it works:
